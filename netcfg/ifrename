#
# Interface renaming rules
#
# Format: NAME,MAC,NEWNAME
#
# NAME and MAC are shell glob patterns. Both must match for a rule to apply.
# The first matching rule is chosen (top to bottom).
#
# Interfaces with the same NEWNAME are sorted by MAC and have a running
# index appended to their new name.
#
# Example: rename all ethernet interfaces to "port<X>"
# eth*,*,port
